## Reporting a Vulnerability

Contact me directly through the email in the author field in `package.json`. I'll get
back to you as soon as I see it.

As Github puts it:

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

If it's a very minor vulnerability, feel free to open
an issue instead. Also feel free to open a PR to resolve that issue if you want to.
